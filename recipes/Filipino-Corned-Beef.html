        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My dad use to make this all the time, growing up. I forgot how good it was until St. Patrick's day came around and everyone started talking about corned beef and cabbage. So here is the recipe, similar to the way he made it - quick and easy with canned corned beef. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup butter </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil  </li>
            <li>½ onion, chopped  </li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced r </li>
            <li>4 Roma tomatoes, cubed </li>
            <li>⅓ small head cabbage, cored and cut into strips  </li>
            <li>¼ cup chicken stock, or more to taste  </li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can corned beef  </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat butter and oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and heat through, about 3 minutes.</li>

            <li>Mix in corned beef and cook until heated through and flavors have combined, about 10 minutes</li>
        </ol>
